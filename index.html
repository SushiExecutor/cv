    <h3>Personal Background</h3>
    <p>I'm a beginner Roblox developer, currently expanding on the basic knowledge that I already have. I've taken my interest with scripting and used it for Web Development, but in time I plan to script in many different ways. This website is a sample of some of my work, in fact it's my first ever made website. You'll notice this website will be updated frequently as I expand from what I already know. And as I gain more experience I will apply what I know to Roblox. I hope you find what you're looking for after reviewing my work.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I joined Roblox in 2016</li>
      <li>I charge for what I do</li>
      <li>If you find my contact page at the bottom you can message me if interested in hiring</li>
